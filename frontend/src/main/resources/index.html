<!-- Kotlin/JS projects are automatically bundled with all of your code and its dependencies
into a single JavaScript file with the same name as the project, confexplorer.js, when you build
them. As a typical JavaScript convention, the content of the body (including the root div) is
loaded first to ensure that the browser loads all page elements before the scripts. -->
